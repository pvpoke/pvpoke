			<title>Ultra League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[We're just over a month through the season, and today's update focuses on Ultra League top performers. I've updated training analysis with the sampling of Ultra League battles so far, so take a look for potential Pokemon and team ideas!<br><br>There aren't many shakeups in Ultra League this season, but some trainers found success with Bulldoze on Zygarde Complete. If you happen to have access to this rare Pokemon, it has a few different viable movesets. Zygarde is just about the only Pokemon that can make Bulldoze work thanks to its enormous stat product.<br><br>Top team data is limited. Common threads include Water types like Feraligatr, Greninja, or Gastrodon paired with Poison types like Shadow Drapion or Galarian Weezing. Drifblim is also a notable top individual and team performer.<br><br>Good luck in your battles and stay tuned, there are some exciting PvP Pokemon on the horizon!]]>

			<title>Dachsbun and Meowscarada Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Fidough and Dachsbun debut in an upcoming event challenge, and the latter isn't releasing half-baked. Dachsbun has solid stat product, Charm, and 35-energy attacks in Psychic Fangs and Body Slam. Altogether, Dachsbun looks every bit as good as Wigglytuff if not slightly better. It has slightly higher stat product than Wigglytuff and, more importantly, reaches its Charged Attacks faster. The downside is it lacks Normal typing which gives Wigglytuff the edge against Pokemon like Feraligatr and Galarian Corsola. All in all, Dachsbun should be immediately competitive in Great League.<br><br>Sprigatito Community Day adds Frenzy Plant as an exclusive move and Flower Trick as a regular move to Meowscarada's movepool. Flower Trick is an attack-boosting move that's closer to Power-Up Punch than Rage Fist. With its glassy stat distribution and a lackluster Fast Attack in Leafage, Meowscarada will need to wait for future move updates to see play. Make sure to grab some for the collection!]]>

			<title>Color Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Color Cup returns to Great League this January, featuring Water, Fire, Grass, and Electric types. Seasoned battlers might notice this is just Element Cup plus Electric, another type that resists itself. The best Pokemon in this cup will be the ones that beat their own type and provide corebreaking opportunities against the rest.<br><br>These Pokemon include current Great League favorites like Toxapex, Jumpluff, and the rising Unova Stunfisk. Qwilfish, Alolan Marowak, and Abomasnow also look like promising picks. Ground should play a major role in this meta with the presence of Gastrodon, super effective against many top picks. While it dodges Grass types, Ice will be dodging Fire to corner them both. It isn't high up in the rankings, but Dewgong stands out as a mold breaker with play against much of the field.<br><br>Despite the small meta, there should be interesting core and corebreaker dynamics. The biggest question is if prevalent double weaknesses and hard counter relationships will hamper team building. Happy holidarys and good luck!]]>

			<title>Updated Great League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Top performers have been updated with a first look at the meta this season! The overall changes are small, but there are notable shifts just within the first week.<br><br>Diggersby and Morpeko top the individual performers, both with buffs this season. Annihilape and Primeape are also firmly in the running, with Annihilape scoring slightly ahead of Primeape. On top performing teams, there's a good amount of variety. Common elements include Normal types (Diggersby or Dunsparce), Water types (Feraligatr, Gastrodon, and Azumarill), and a resurgence in Grass (Serperior, Jumpluff, and a few Ferrothorn).<br><br>A few newcomers don't have enough data to support them yet, such as Bibarel, Starmie, and Thunder Fang Steelix. Time will tell if these Pokemon have a shot at a meta or anti-meta role. Stay tuned for more updates!]]>

			<title>Little Holiday Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Little Holiday Cup returns in a few weeks, although note that Smeargle's eligibility is still tentative. (It was included and then later banned prior to the cup's previous release.)<br><br>Besides Smeargle, the cup's strongest contenders include Alolan Sandslash, Fire types like Alolan Marowak, Skeledirge, and Litwick, Pikachu Libre, and other odd picks like Miltank or Amaura. As always, Fast Attack pressure can be lethal in Little Cup, so watch out for Charm users like Wigglytuff and Alolan Ninetales, too.]]>

			<title>Updates for Dual Destiny</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The site has been updated for the current season, Dual Destiny! This season brings a few minor attack updates, including buffs to Thunder Shock, the Elemental Fangs, and the Elemental Punches.<br><br>Thunder Shock's increase in base power makes it equivalent to Poison Sting again. If you weren't seeing it enough already, this change should solidify Morpeko as a core meta Pokemon. Its ability to farm down opponents is now improved, especially after Attack boosts. Morpeko previously sat low in the rankings, but I've updated its Consistency score to better reflect how it's used in play.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Fang and Punch buffs only have minor impact. Few Pokemon can use the Fangs effectively, limited to Steelix, Mawile, and potentially Arctibax. Even then, their alternative attacks may be better. Alolan Sandslash, Diggersby, Goodra, Shadow Typhlosion, and Groudon all benefit from the Punch buffs and should see more play into this season.<br><br>Good luck with your early battles and see you for more updates!]]>

			<title>Updated Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've posted training analysis for all three leagues and the final analysis for the season! The past month included several Great League cups, so note that the top performers may be skewed by some practice teams from Halloween, Remix, and Retro. Good luck the final week of the season and see you for the next one on December 1st!]]>

			<title>Galarian Corsola and Cursola Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Galarian Corsola is debuting in the season finale event, and barring any prerelease changes, it looks like a monster for PvP. It pairs high bulk with strong moves in Astonish and Night Shade plus Power Gem for coverage, all three of which got buffed this past season.<br><br>This ghost demolishes the newly invigorated Annihilape and provides a solid answer to meta Poison types like Clodsire and Ariados. It does have to contend with prominent Normal and Dark types like Dunsparce, Drapion, and Mandibuzz, so it's not without its flaws. Similar to Bastiodon and Carbin, Galarian Corsola reaches its highest stat product at level 50, but high IV versions can be fielded near level 40.<br><br>Meanwhile, Cursola can reach higher CP than Corsola but is a true glass cannon. It lacks the stat product and moves to compete in any of the three leagues. It's ultimately unlikely to find a niche over other Ghosts.]]>

			<title>Retro Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Sometimes retro things make a comeback, and that includes Retro Cup this November. Steel, Fairy, and Dark types are banned, which leaves a pretty wide pool remaining that should play pretty close to open Great League. However, the door is open for more Dragon, Ghost, Ice, and Psychic types to see play. Double Dragon may prove to be a popular strategy again since Dragon attacks are unresisted. Normal types should also play a key role as the only Ghost resistance in the meta. Check out the rankings for more details!]]>

			<title>Updated Great League Top Performers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[With GO Battle Weekend beginning tomorrow, I've updated the Training Analysis page with top performers from the past few weeks of Great League practice. The Pokemon topping the charts are by and large established meta at this point, although Morpeko and even Pangoro put up some good recent numbers. Clodsire dominates the top performing teams, most often partnered with a Water type such as Feraligatr, Azumarill, or Gastrodon. Good luck in your battles!]]>

			<title>Site Performance Improvements</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've launched performance improvements to the Rankings page which should now be faster and more lightweight. If you notice any freezing, lag, or slowdown, you can also enable a new Performance Mode option from the Settings page, which further improves CPU performance on the Rankings page.]]>

			<title>Willpower Cup Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Willpower Cup returns featuring Dark, Psychic, and Fighting-type Pokemon. Gardevoir is banned, but other Fairies sneak through, including Hatterene and Galarian Rapidash. With few resistances, Charm could be a running theme, but Poison Jab and Poison Sting are strong enough to overcome it. Some niche Pokemon like Claydol should also see play. Have fun!]]>

			<title>Morpeko Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Morpeko will debut as the first Pokemon to change forms mid-battle! This form change occurs whenever it uses a Charged Attack. Depending on its form, its powerful signature move, Aura Wheel, is either an Electric-type or Dark-type attack.<br><br>Morpeko fits the mold of other glassy Electric types like Magnezone, Togedemaru, and Luxray, equipped with a bait move and a powerful nuke. It's likely to remain spice but should be fun to experiment with. We'll see if the form change mechanic comes to other Pokemon in the future!]]>

			<title>Expanded Multi-Battle and Matrix Battle Options</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The groups you set for Multi-Battle and Matrix Battle now feature the same simulation options as Single Battle, such as starting HP, starting energy, and stat modifiers. You can use these options to explore advanced scenarios, such as which Pokemon can beat Clodsire after switching in, or breakpoints between different IV spreads when you have an Attack buff. Enjoy tinkering around!]]>
