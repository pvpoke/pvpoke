			<title>Site Updated for Season of Timeless Travels!</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The website is updated with the move changes for Season of Timeless Travels! Rankings, battle simulations, and the team builder now include the latest changes for this season. Retro Cup rankings are also now available, and Holiday Cup rankings will be coming shortly. You can expect a top performer update on the Training Analysis page after the first week of the season.<br><br>For this season, I've included two entries for Lanturn in the Great League rankings—one with Spark and one with Water Gun. Lanturn is the only Pokemon to be featured this way given its importance in the metagame, but I'll be considering how to expand this for the future.<br><br>Good luck in your battles!]]>

			<title>Added Hisuian Starters</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The Hisuian starter Pokemon are now available on the site, with Hisuian Samurott making its debut this Sunday! Note that these Pokemon do not have their Community Day exclusive moves available via Elite TM at this time. Hisuian Samurott will need to wait for Hydro Cannon to see much viability, and even then it's unlikely to surpass Greninja.<br><br>With this update, I've also fixed an issue where navigating directly to Multi-Battle would show results against all Pokemon instead of just the meta Pokemon.]]>

			<title>Custom Moves to Preview New Season Updates</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[If you're looking to get a peek at next season's updates, I've added duplicates of the moves which are receiving changes so you can use them in the simulations. Some of these values are speculative since energy values won't be known until the season begins on Friday. A full site update will come then!]]>

			<title>Season of Timeless Travels Announced</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[The latest season and move updates have been announced! There is a lot to explore with nerfs to Psychic, buffs for Fire types, and wide move distributions for Trailblaze, Scald, Fly, and more. Not all of the move update numbers are known, so PvPoke will be updated for the new season after it begins on Friday, December 1st. See you then!]]>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[Ultra League top performers have been updated with the past month of training data. Golisopod has continued to prove its part in the meta, and top teams are showing variety with Cresselia and Steelix as common anchors in the back. Take a look!]]>

			<title>Site Update 1.31.0 - RSS News Feed</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Site updates will now appear in a news feed on the homepage! I've previously posted these updates to Twitter, but as Twitter has become less accessible, I've been looking to make them available on the website itself. Subscribe with any RSS reader to stay updated on new rankings, top performer teams, and other site updates!]]>

			<title>Mega Garchomp Added</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Mega Garchomp has been added to the main site! It boasts incredible stats, but lives in Rayquaza's shadow, and has tough moveset choices to make. Happy raiding!]]>

			<title>Great League Top Performers Update</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Coming at you with a mid-week top performer update featuring Clodsire! Mud Shot has an early lead over Poison Sting, but overall, multiple movesets look viable. Dewgong and Jellicent stand to gain if Clodsire hangs around (and Regi doesn't).]]>

			<title>Bellibolt Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Bellibolt has been added to the rankings. It's bulkier than most Electric types with play in both Great and Ultra League. Unfortunately it lacks any coverage, so it will be hindered until a future update. Few can say that Bellibolt doesn't spark joy, though!]]>

			<title>Great League Top Performers Update</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[I've updated top performers with data from the past few weeks of Great League training. With Medicham, Sableye, Lickitung, and Serperior all solidifying their places in the meta, Noctowl showed strong anti-meta potential. Good luck in your battles!]]>

			<title>Wooper Community Day PvP Guide</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[A PvP guide for Wooper Community Day is now available! Both evolutions are excellent additions for your roster. I've included some specialized IV spreads for the Clodsire mirror matchup, and a Quagsire spread that's more consistent
				against Gligar. Have fun!]]>

			<title>Clodsire Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Clodsire rankings are now available. With its current moveset, it will still be a powerful Pokemon in Great League but its challenges against Medicham, Gligar, and Grass may limit its meta impact. Check it out!]]>

			<title>New Shadow Pokemon Rankings</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Rankings are updated with the newest Shadow Pokemon! Whiscash is the most PvP ready, while Gengar, Haunter, and Excadrill are all offensive powerhouses alongside the surprise debuts of Hisuian Sneasel and Sneasler. Most of these Shadow
				forms improve upon the originals, so be sure to catch them this rotation!]]>
