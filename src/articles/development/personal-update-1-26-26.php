<p>I live in Minneapolis. Friday, I and tens of thousands of citizens peacefully marched in -20<strong>&deg;</strong> F wind chill to protest ICE's violent and unlawful occupation of our city. Not twenty four hours later, ICE agents surrounded a Minneapolis man, pummeled him, and executed him on the street in broad daylight.</p>

<p>His name was Alex Pretti. He was 37 years old and an ICU nurse at the VA Medical Center. In the moment before his murder, he was helping a woman whom ICE agents had already sprayed and beaten. He never reached for his holstered gun, which he was legally permitted to carry, and ICE stripped him of it just before they shot him with their own.</p>

<p>This is the second murder by ICE agents in Minneapolis this month. Candles still burn at the memorial for Renee Good, wife and mother of three, whom ICE shot and killed as she attempted to drive away.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening right now in the United States, this is my alarm for anyone who will listen.</p>

<p>We are witnessing a campaign of fear, revenge, and violence being conducted by our federal government against America. They operate with impunity and without regard for law or life. Today is my city. Tomorrow could be yours. And if they are willing to shoot Renee Good and Alex Pretti, they are willing to shoot you.</p>

<p>They will call you a domestic terrorist. They will call you an agitator. They will call you a leftist, a radical, a would-be assassin. They will investigate your grieving family for any sign of dissention before they check you for any sign of a pulse. They will decry outrage and opposition as calls for violence while their agents shoot your lifeless body for sport.</p>

<p>It is not enough to be compliant. It is not enough to abide by laws that they refuse to follow. It is not enough to be a U.S. citizen and show them proof that they demand but won&rsquo;t believe.</p>

<p>In case recent years have become a blur, none of this is normal. It is not normal for schools to close because federal agents are preying on their students. It is not normal for the government to invade homes without cause and abduct families at gunpoint. And unfortunately, we have arrived here, inch by inch, because we collectively accepted each of the appalling steps before these ones.</p>

<p>Over the past ten years, a fascist regime has risen under Donald Trump by controlling the media, dismantling our government's checks and balances, and storming our nation&rsquo;s Capitol to overthrow democracy. They succeeded. Those same insurrectionists are now invading our streets, masked, militarized, and utterly remorseless.</p>

<p>One of the most infuriating parts is that our local officials still cling to the old normal. They send sternly worded letters, deliver angry remarks at podiums, and make appeals to bipartisanship and cooperation. But, for the lack of better words, their controllers have been disconnected. America&rsquo;s political and judicial systems are so thoroughly sabotaged that there is no political recourse left to hold this administration accountable for any of its crimes.</p>

<p>Yet we are obliged to remain peaceful. We are expected to stay &ldquo;Minnesota Nice&rdquo; while our oppressors execute us before our neighbors&rsquo; eyes. I don&rsquo;t know what the path forward is, but there can&rsquo;t be change without collective and conscious resistance. And if there is no change, if ICE keeps inflicting violence after violence, our obligation to peace will not last.</p>

<p>If you are uncomfortable and unsure, look outward and ask:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are the government&rsquo;s statements truthful to the videos and witness testimony?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>If immigration enforcement was carried out by good, honest people, would it look like this?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Would a government that stands for law and order abide by the law or claim immunity from it? Would a government that stands for law and order observe due process or deprive people of it?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>If the administration and its supporters are merely against illegal immigration, do they defend the rights and livelihoods of legal immigrants?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Have they ever sought to revoke the legal status or even citizenship from people who did immigrate legally? If so, is it really illegal immigration that they are against?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Is our nation still a nation of immigrants? If not, when did it stop?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>If our leaders are patriots and pro-America, do they uphold its Constitution and Bill of Rights?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>If our leaders are Christian and claim that this is a Christian nation, do they follow the most basic commandments and teachings of Christ?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Do our leaders use their positions of office to benefit the American people or to benefit themselves?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Would our leaders ever peacefully step down from power now that they&rsquo;ve seized it?</li>
</ul>

<p>This is my alarm for anyone who will listen. Smoke is filling the halls. You can close your door if you want to, but the fire will burn through it, and at this stage, it may be too late to stop.</p>

<p>We are simultaneously together and alone. No one is coming to save us. Good is not guaranteed to survive. The least we can do is sound the alarm for others and stand for one another. Love your neighbor. Defend your rights. A time may come when we have the chance to rebuild, when the true scale of the atrocities will be unmasked. First, we must resist, and resist together.</p>

<p>-Matt</p>
