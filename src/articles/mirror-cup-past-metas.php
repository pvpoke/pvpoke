	<p>Who is fairest of them all? In the Mirror Cup,  you and your community get to decide! Any of the previous monthly themed cups  are available to choose from. But lots has changed since! New Pokemon and  movesets have been added, and some metas may look completely different than  what we remember. Let&rsquo;s pay them a visit and see what&rsquo;s new! I've also rated each cup based on balance, accessibility, and change since they last appeared to help compare cups if you're deciding on a cup for your community.</p>

<strong>Key Changes:</strong></p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>More accessible Skarmory counters</li>
        <li>Power-Up Punch Medicham can go toe to toe with Skarmory and dominate 2-shield matchups</li>
        <li>Hydro Cannon Swampert competes for the Mudboi slot</li>
        <li>New Confusion users look to even the playing field</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What humble beginnings! Those who remember  Boulder Cup probably remember the double Skarmory menace. That can no longer be a thing with the species clause, but <strong>Skarmory is still  top bird</strong> with a heap of positive matchups. Countering Skarmory used to mean  investing in Melmetal, finding a legacy Magneton, or opting for Steelix, but  now <strong>Probopass </strong>and <strong>Magnezone </strong>are also within reach. <strong>Bastiodon </strong>is  an option, too, but all of these alternatives will have a very hard time  against Medicham and the mudbois. </p>
      <p>Medicham was a big player before, and it didn&rsquo;t  even have Power-Up Punch back then. Now, <strong>Medicham is a wrecking ball</strong> that only has 3 losses in the 2-shield scenario: Torterra, Charm Gallade, and  Charm Donphan. <strong>Charm is the only way to hard counter Medicham,</strong> and it&rsquo;s  a risky proposition with all the Steel types about, leaving these Pokemon  vulnerable to being hard countered themselves. </p>
      <p>Marshtomp and Whiscash were previous favorites  in the Water/Ground category, with relatively solid matchups across the cup and  acting as Skarmory&rsquo;s bodyguard. <strong>Hydro Cannon Swampert takes over that role</strong> with insane damage and a generally even matchup with Skarmory itself. Some may  still prefer Whiscash for its bulk and ability to threaten its Grass counters  with Blizzard. </p>
      <p>A bunch of new Confusion users are also looking  to mix things up, including Bronzong, Gallade, and Jirachi.  They are each well rounded in their own right and pick up some important  matchups, including Torterra and Medicham. <strong>Gallade can provide additional  Grass support </strong>(but will need backup to deal with Swampert) while <strong>Bronzong  and Jirachi have an even Skarmory matchup </strong>and can deal with Grass better  thanks to their Steel typing. With these newcomers, we can probably kiss  Breloom goodbye, too.</p>

  <h3 class="article-header">Twilight Cup</h3>
	<strong><a href="https://pvpoke.com/rankings/twilight/1500/overall/" target="_blank">Twilight Cup Rankings</a></strong><br>

<strong>Accessibility:</strong>&nbsp; &#9733; &#9733; &#9734; &#9734;<br>
<strong>Change:</strong>&nbsp; &#9733; &#9733; &#9734; &#9734;<br>
  <strong>Key Changes:</strong></p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Acid Spray will keep everyone on their toes</li>
        <li>Charm Togekiss gets to be the fairy that Togetic always       wanted to be</li>
        <li>Earth Power makes Nidoqueen more viable</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Twilight Cup should look mostly familiar. There  aren&rsquo;t many big new players, but the old ones have some new tricks. During  Twilight Cup, stat boosts were just becoming a thing and Silver Wind was all  the rage. Now it&rsquo;s joined by Acid Spray, which throws a curveball at the entire  cup. <strong>Tentacruel can now bait shields</strong>, making it even more potent than  before, and <strong>Alolan Muk is strongly positioned in the Dark/Poison category  with hit and run tactics.</strong> Acid Spray could be devastating when paired with  high damage moves like Razor Leaf or Charm. Acid Spray is also an option on  Qwilfish, especially in the lead position, but some may prefer Sludge Wave to  target Azumarill. </p>
      <p>So many Twilight Cup rosters were hungry for a  Fairy Fast Move, and now we have it! <strong>Togekiss stands out with coverage moves  against Golbat, Venomoth, and Venusaur. </strong>Charm also shreds through the  Twilight staple, Toxcroak (but watch out for Sludge Bomb). Granbull and  Gardevoir are also on the table if you want to avoid Rock or Ice weaknesses,  but come with their own drawbacks as well. Charm users could potentially be  used in place of traditional Toxicroak counters like Golbat and Venomoth thanks  to their strength against Dark types. Consider your team and coverages  carefully! </p>
      <p>Lastly, while Nidoqueen was more of a B-team  option for those without Toxicroak, Earth Power gives it some more oomph this  time around. It&rsquo;s more capable of taking on Poison targets in shielded  scenarios now, and Stone Edge continues to give it valuable coverage. Perhaps  worth considering!</p>

      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Hydro Cannon Swampert is crashing this cup with no       survivors</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tempest Cup is almost exactly as you remember  it; Lanturn is zapping things up, Lapras is playing hide-and-seek with  Abomasnow and Tropius, and Skarmory is shredding them into energy batteries.  Classic Skarmory! Like in Boulder Cup, Hydro Cannon Swampert now gives the  other mudbois a run for their money. <strong>Swampert can beat or tie the former  frontrunners</strong>, Whiscash and Quagsire, and plays  Skarmory much closer. When it comes down to it, Whiscash may still end up being  preferred for the late-game Blizzard. </p>
      <p>Not necessarily a matchup change, but now that  many more people have access to Ice Shard Lapras, I&rsquo;d anticipate seeing it much  more than Sealeo in a revamped Tempest Cup.</p>

<h3 class="article-header">Kingdom Cup</h3>
<p>
	<strong><a href="https://pvpoke.com/rankings/kingdom/1500/overall/" target="_blank">Kingdom Cup Rankings</a></strong><br>
  <strong>Types: </strong>Ice, Fire, Steel, Dragon <br>
<strong>Balance:</strong>&nbsp; &#9733; &#9733; &#9734; &#9734;<br>
<strong>Accessibility:</strong>&nbsp; &#9733; &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;<br>
<strong>Change:</strong>&nbsp; &#9733; &#9734; &#9734; &#9734;<br>
  <strong>Key Changes:</strong></p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Blaziken gets a speed boost</li>
        <li>A viable budget Bastiodon replacement in Probopass</li>
        <li>Bronzong locks down previously iffy matchups and gains       valuable coverage</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>The infamous BALL core is likely still intact</strong> (Bastiodon, Altaria, Lucario, Lapras), but some of the wild card  picks are more up in the air. Blaziken, who can beat or go even with 3/4 of the  core, now has access to Blaze Kick. Where before it had to be well positioned  to reach even just one Charged Move, <strong>Blaziken can pump out more consistent  damage and do some shield bait trickery if it&rsquo;s brave</strong>. There are a variety  of possible movesets; Blaze Kick and Blast Burn offer the most flexibility and  power but get walled by Altaria. Brave Bird can do some neutral chunk damage,  and Focus Blast still looks really good as a late game nuke against Lapras or  Bastiodon. </p>
      <p>One big problem with the Kingdom Cups of yore  was the accessibility of some of its most powerful Pokemon. Bastiodon had  people digging up fossils as well as Stardust from under their couch cushions. <strong>Probopass  is now available as a genuine Bastiodon replacement. </strong>Before, teams could  roll with Steelix, Bronzong, or other options but never quite fill that  triceratops-shaped gap. Probopass is functionally nearly identical to Bastiodon  and won&rsquo;t send your Stardust funds back to the Cretacious. </p>
      <p>Bronzong was an interesting pick with a unique  set of matchups, but those matches were somewhat haphazard. <strong>Bronzong can now  consistently beat Lapras in the 1-shield scenario with Psyshock spam</strong>. Its  Altaria matchup stays close but positive with Psyshock, too. Psyshock also  packs a greater punch than Heavy Slam against Lucario if you can land it.  (Generally you just want to spam Confusion against Lucario, and there&rsquo;s even a <a href="https://pvpoke.com/battle/1500/bronzong-26.5-3-1-8-4-4-1/lucario/11/0-0-0/1-4-3/">breakpoint</a> you might be able to hit!) </p>

<h3 class="article-header">Season 1 Regionals</h3>
	<strong><a href="https://pvpoke.com/rankings/regionals-1/1500/overall/" target="_blank">Season 1 Regionals Rankings</a></strong><br>
  <strong>Types: </strong>Rock, Ground, Fighting, Ice, Fire, Steel, Dragon, Poison, Dark, Fairy, Ghost, Flying, Electric<br>

<strong>Accessibility:</strong>&nbsp; &#9733; &#9733; &#9734; &#9734;<br>
<strong>Change:</strong>&nbsp; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9734;<br>
  <strong>Key Changes:</strong></p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Don't sleep on Jirachi</li>
        <li>More people might run Swampert or a mudboi</li>
        <li>Charm is doing Charm things</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Like open Great League, the Season 1 Regional meta could see a significant shift with the introduction of Charm. There's more to keep Medicham up at night and Sableye is sweating ghost sweats. How exactly Charm will impact the meta remains to be seen but it opens up an entire new coverage option that wasn't really present before. <strong>Wigglytuff and Clefable are the top Charm candidates</strong>, with Wigglytuff's unique resistance to Ghost and Clefable's Meteor Mash. In response, I think Skarmory's place will solidify and Altaria will fall out almost completely. If you didn't have it on your team previously, a Bastiodon or Probopass can also provide helpful anti-Charm support.</p>
	<p>As Poison could potentially rise, Jirachi enters the fray as a top contendor with positive matchups across the field. There were quite a few Confusion options last time between Hypno and Gallade, and while Jirachi does slightly different things, I think it's definitely worth a look. Meanwhile, not everyone packed a Water/Ground Pokemon last time, but Swampert could draw some attention, too.</p>
	<p>This section deserves more analysis, but the Regionals/open format is also one of the more challenging to unpack. We'll see how it shakes out!</p>

        <strong>Key Changes:</strong></p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>So funny story</li>
        <li>Charm Gardevoir annihilates everything</li>
        <li>Run Double Dark team comps at your peril</li>
        <li>Lucario potentially over Toxicroak</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you think Vigoroth is the most dominant meta  Pokemon we&rsquo;ve ever seen, get ready for this. Charm Gardevoir has a <a href="https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/1500/nightmare/gardevoir/11/1-1-3/2-1/" target="_blank">91% win rate</a> in the 1-shield scenario and a <a href="https://pvpoke.com/battle/multi/1500/nightmare/gardevoir/22/1-1-3/2-1/" target="_blank">92% win rate</a> in the 2-shield scenario. Its top  counters start with a Battle Rating of 660. And after it&rsquo;s done wiping the  floor with your poor opponent, your pick of Dazzling Gleam or Shadow Ball will  either force a shield, one-shot, or severely cripple whichever Pokemon comes in  to face it. In case it bears repeating, <strong>Charm Gardevoir annihilates (almost) everything.</strong></p>
      <p>So what beats Gardevoir? <strong>Bronzong is your  best bet </strong>with either Confusion or Feint Attack, followed by Metagross and  Metang. Confusion Bronzong does the job while giving it much better matchups  against Toxicroak and Lucario. With Feint Attack, you have the edge against  Metagross and Metang, so there are some coverage decisions to be made. <strong>Dark/Poisons  also play close or even with Gardevoir</strong> and can squeak out potential wins  depending on IV&rsquo;s, so it&rsquo;s not all doom and gloom. <strong>Bite Drapion</strong> has the best matchup there and should beat Gardevoir through sheer bite force.</p>
      <p>These Pokemon are in turn beaten by Dark-type  staples like Umbreon and Alolan Raticate. Fighting Pokemon can carve out a spot  on the roster against Gardevoir counters and Gardevoir counter-counters. <strong>Lucario  emerges as a favorite over Toxicroak</strong> for its ability to go even with  Bronzong and hardened resistances against Poison and Steel. Toxicroak can also  still succeed but may have a much tougher time since the traditional  Fighting-Dark-Psychic trio has broken down. </p>
      <p>Where are all the other Nightmare players  floating around? <strong>Hypno is still looking strong </strong>with Fire Punch and  Shadow Ball giving it multiple super effective options against some of the  threats above. Note that Gardevoir can take down Hypno through sheer Charm  damage, and Hypno can neither Fire Punch + Shadow Ball or Shadow Ball + Shadow  Ball without an energy advantage. </p>
      <p>Xatu and Alolan Raichu are in a similar boat  where they&rsquo;re fairly well rounded but lose to much of the apparent new meta,  such as Gardevoir, the Steel types, and Dark/Poisons. Taking on Lucario and its  Shadow Ball is also risky business! Shiftry is also looking pretty shifty these  days. </p>
      <p>And lastly, what about Spiritomb? Charm is an  obvious threat alongside all Dark types, so I think <strong>Spiritomb will have a  much tougher time finding a roster spot</strong>. It could act as a scarecrow to  force apart an otherwise strong pairing between Bronzong and Lucario. (Claydol  is also looking on with hungry eyes). </p>

      </ul>
      <p>Really not much different here! The only notable  movepool addition here is Charm for Raichu, but it&rsquo;s too frail, lacks same type  attack bonus, and Charm doesn&rsquo;t have any front and center targets. It&rsquo;s  business as usual with Forretress, Charizard, and Venusaur playing  merry-go-round and Quagsire playing merry-go-ground. (I&rsquo;m an Earthquake fan.) </p>

	<h3 class="article-header">Choosing Your Cup</h3>
	<p>Are you a community leader trying to decide on which cup to pick? Here are a few tips or suggestions that can help:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Put up a poll or ask your community which cup they'd be interested in most</li>
		<li>Decide early so your community can practice and prepare</li>
		<li>Consider which meta relevant Pokemon appear most frequently in your local biome to help newcomers build new teams or veterans find better catches</li>
		<li>Try some practice matches in each cup and see which feels the most fun</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Good luck, and happy battling!</p>
