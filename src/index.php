	<h4>v1.14.3 (March 22, 2020)</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Rankings now display Pokemon typing, weaknesses, and resistances.</li>
		<li>Identified and fixed a rounding issue with type effectiveness in damage calculations for double- and triple-resisted moves.</li>

		</ul>
		<li>Fixed a breakpoint calculation issue for guaranteeing breakpoints against Shadow Pokemon.</li>
		<li>Search bar processing on Rankings and Multi-Battle has been tweaked for smoother typing on mobile.</li>
