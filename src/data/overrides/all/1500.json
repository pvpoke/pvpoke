Scizor brings incredible Fast Attack pressure into the meta, especially against Cradily. Since Fire types are relatively rare, Scizor has seen more open play. Scizor's ability to deal damage is just as polarizing as its inability to take damage. Good prediction skills, careful piloting, and a dose of luck all help its competitive success."},{"speciesId":"scolipede","fastMove":"POISON_STING","chargedMoves":["X_SCISSOR","MEGAHORN"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"scolipede_shadow","fastMove":"POISON_STING","chargedMoves":["X_SCISSOR","MEGAHORN"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"scrafty","fastMove":"COUNTER","chargedMoves":["FOUL_PLAY","THUNDER_PUNCH"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"sealeo","fastMove":"POWDER_SNOW","chargedMoves":["SURF","BODY_SLAM"],"weight":8},{"speciesId":"sealeo_shadow","fastMove":"POWDER_SNOW","chargedMoves":["SURF","BODY_SLAM"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"seismitoad","fastMove":"MUD_SHOT","chargedMoves":["EARTH_POWER","SLUDGE_BOMB"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"serperior","fastMove":"VINE_WHIP","chargedMoves":["FRENZY_PLANT","AERIAL_ACE"],"weight":2},{"speciesId":"servine","fastMove":"VINE_WHIP","chargedMoves":["GRASS_KNOT","WRAP"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"servine_shadow","fastMove":"VINE_WHIP","chargedMoves":["GRASS_KNOT","WRAP"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"seviper","fastMove":"POISON_JAB","chargedMoves":["POISON_FANG","WRAP"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"shaymin_land","fastMove":"MAGICAL_LEAF","chargedMoves":["GRASS_KNOT","SEED_FLARE"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"shelgon","fastMove":"DRAGON_BREATH","chargedMoves":["CRUNCH","DRAGON_PULSE"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"shiftry","fastMove":"SNARL","weight":1},{"speciesId":"shiftry_shadow","fastMove":"SNARL","weight":1},{"speciesId":"sirfetchd","fastMove":"FURY_CUTTER","chargedMoves":["LEAF_BLADE","CLOSE_COMBAT"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"skarmory","fastMove":"AIR_SLASH","chargedMoves":["BRAVE_BIRD","SKY_ATTACK"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"skarmory_shadow","fastMove":"AIR_SLASH","chargedMoves":["BRAVE_BIRD","SKY_ATTACK"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"skeledirge","fastMove":"INCINERATE","chargedMoves":["TORCH_SONG","SHADOW_BALL"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"skuntank","fastMove":"POISON_JAB","chargedMoves":["CRUNCH","TRAILBLAZE"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"skuntank_shadow","fastMove":"POISON_JAB","chargedMoves":["CRUNCH","TRAILBLAZE"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"slowbro","fastMove":"CONFUSION","chargedMoves":["DRAIN_PUNCH","ICE_BEAM"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"slowbro_galarian","fastMove":"CONFUSION","chargedMoves":["BRUTAL_SWING","SLUDGE_BOMB"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"slowbro_shadow","fastMove":"CONFUSION","chargedMoves":["DRAIN_PUNCH","ICE_BEAM"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"slowking","fastMove":"CONFUSION","chargedMoves":["SURF","BLIZZARD"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"slowking_galarian","fastMove":"ACID","chargedMoves":["PSYSHOCK","SHADOW_BALL"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"slowking_shadow","fastMove":"CONFUSION","chargedMoves":["SURF","BLIZZARD"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"slurpuff","fastMove":"FAIRY_WIND","chargedMoves":["PLAY_ROUGH","ENERGY_BALL"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"snorlax","chargedMoves":["BODY_SLAM","SUPER_POWER"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"spidops","fastMove":"SHADOW_CLAW","chargedMoves":["LUNGE","ROCK_TOMB"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"spiritomb","fastMove":"SUCKER_PUNCH","chargedMoves":["ROCK_TOMB","SHADOW_BALL"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"staraptor","fastMove":"QUICK_ATTACK","chargedMoves":["FLY","CLOSE_COMBAT"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"staraptor_shadow","fastMove":"QUICK_ATTACK","chargedMoves":["FLY","CLOSE_COMBAT"],"weight":1},{"speciesId":"steelix","fastMove":"THUNDER_FANG","chargedMoves":["PSYCHIC_FANGS","CRUNCH"],"weight":1,"editorScore":85,"editorNotes":"Shadow Steelix is typically preferred over the regular variant for additional Fast Attack pressure and the boost to its non-STAB attacks."},{"speciesId":"steelix_shadow","fastMove":"THUNDER_FANG","chargedMoves":["PSYCHIC_FANGS","CRUNCH"],"weight":12,"editorScore":90,"editorNotes":"True to its name, Shadow Steelix is among the standout Steel types in the format.
