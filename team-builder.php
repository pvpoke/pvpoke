				<div grade="C">This team has only somewhat safe matchups. It may have limited safe switch options or struggle without switch advantage. Consider alternatives with good bulk or coverage to provide more flexibility. Otherwise, be prepared to spend shields to line up your Pokemon in the right matchups.</div>
